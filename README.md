## **THEORY**

An embedded system is a microprocessor-based computer hardware system with software that is designed to perform a dedicated function, either as an independent system or as a part of a large system. At the core is an integrated circuit designed to carry out computation for real-time operations.

## **How an Embedded System Works**

Embedded systems are managed by microcontrollers or digital signal processors (DSP), application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), GPU technology, and gate arrays. These processing systems are integrated with components dedicated to handling electric and/or mechanical interfacing.


## ***Basic Structure of an Embedded System***

The basic structure of an embedded system includes the following components:

## Sensor:
The sensor measures and converts the physical quantity to an electrical signal, which can then be read by an embedded systems engineer or any electronic instrument. A sensor stores the measured quantity to the memory.


## A-D Converter: 
An analog-to-digital converter converts the analog signal sent by the sensor into a digital signal.


## Processor & ASICs: 
Processors assess the data to measure the output and store it to the memory.


## D-A Converter: 
A digital-to-analog converter changes the digital data fed by the processor to analog data.


## Actuator: 
An actuator compares the output given by the D-A Converter to the actual output stored and stores the approved output.
